Configuring bed-and-breakfast-0.4...
Cabal-simple_Z6RU0evB_2.2.0.1_ghc-8.4.3.exe: The package has an impossible
version range for a dependency on an internal library: bed-and-breakfast
==0.3.2. This version range does not include the current package, and must be
removed as the current package's library will always be used.
