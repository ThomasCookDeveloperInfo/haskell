Cabal-simple_Z6RU0evB_2.0.1.0_ghc-8.2.2.exe: Missing dependencies on foreign
libraries:
* Missing C libraries: blas, lapack
This problem can usually be solved by installing the system packages that
provide these libraries (you may need the "-dev" versions). If the libraries
are already installed but in a non-standard location then you can use the
flags --extra-include-dirs= and --extra-lib-dirs= to specify where they are.
