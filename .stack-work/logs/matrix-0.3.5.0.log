Data\Matrix.hs:80:1: warning: [-Wunused-imports]
    The import of `Data.Traversable' is redundant
      except perhaps to import instances from `Data.Traversable'
    To import instances alone, use: import Data.Traversable()

Data\Matrix.hs:88:1: warning: [-Wunused-imports]
    The import of `Data.Maybe' is redundant
      except perhaps to import instances from `Data.Maybe'
    To import instances alone, use: import Data.Maybe()

Data\Matrix.hs:1323:1: warning: [-Winline-rule-shadowing]
    Rule "matrix/traceOfSum" may never fire
      because `trace' might inline first
    Probable fix: add an INLINE[n] or NOINLINE[n] pragma for `trace'

Data\Matrix.hs:1323:1: warning: [-Winline-rule-shadowing]
    Rule "matrix/traceOfSum" may never fire
      because rule "Class op +" for `+' might fire first
    Probable fix: add phase [n] or [~n] to the competing rule

Data\Matrix.hs:1326:1: warning: [-Winline-rule-shadowing]
    Rule "matrix/traceOfScale" may never fire
      because `trace' might inline first
